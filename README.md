## Introduction

DelphiScribe is a project dedicated to computing energy-weighted correlation in particle physics datasets.
It facilitates analysis on both simulated data from Pythia and real data from the CMS Open Data.
The codebase is designed to explore new parameterizations of N-point ENCs, providing tools for advanced data analysis and visualization.


## Features

- **New Angles on Energy Correlators**:

  Introduces a new parameterization for N-point Energy Correlators (ENCs) as detailed in [2410.xxxx].

## Installation

To install DelphiScribe, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DelphiScribe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

    ```
    cd DelphiScribe
    ```

3. **Configure the Makefile**

    Before compiling the code, you'll need to edit `Makefile.inc` to set up the necessary directories:
    * Open `Makefile.inc` in your preferred text editor.
    * Modify the following variables to match the installation paths and versions on your system:
          + `SOFTWARE_DIR`
          + `PYTHIA_DIR`
          + `FASTJET_DIR`

4. **Configure Open Data File Path**

    If you intend to use information from  the CMS Open Data 2011A Jet Primary Dataset:
    * Open `write/include/opendata_utils.h`.
    * Change the `cms_jets_file` variable to point to the location of the CMS Open Data file on your machine.

5. **Compile the Code**

    Run `make` to compile all relevant C++ code and set up a Python virtual environment
    ```
    make
    ```

6. **Create Output Directories**

    Create the necessary directories for storing output data and figures:
    ```
    mkdir -p output/new_encs
    mkdir -p output/new_enc_figures
    ```


## Usage

After installation, you can start computing Energy Correlators using the following commands.


### New Angles on Energy Correlators

To generate files containing N-Point Energy Correlators (ENCs) with the keyword `opendata_test` in the directory `./output/new_encs/`, try running the following commands.
Additional examples, including examples for computing ENCs in Pythia, can be found in `./bin/`.

* Projected ENCs (PENCs)

Generate PENCs by running:

```
./write/new_enc/2particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 [or any list] --n_events 100000 --nbins 200 --file_prefix opendata_test
```

* Resolved 3-Point ENCs (RE3Cs)

Generate RE3Cs with:

```
./write/new_enc/3particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 1.0 [or any set of pairs] --n_events 100000 --nbins 150 --file_prefix opendata_test
```

Resolved 4-Point ENCs (RE4Cs)

Generate RE4Cs using:
```
./write/new_enc/4particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 1.0 1.0 [or any set of triples] --n_events 100000 --nbins 150 --file_prefix opendata_test
```

Each of these commands will produce associated files in output/new_encs. You can use the plotting tools in plot/encs, which can be modified to produce your own versions of the plots from [2410.xxxx].

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

write/: Contains the main C++ source code for computing Energy Correlators.

* new_enc/: Executables for computing Projected ENCs, Resolved 3-Point ENCs, and Resolved 4-Point ENCs.

* src/: Core C++ source files.

* utils/: Utility functions and classes for data processing.

* include/: Header files defining interfaces and data structures.


plot/: Houses Python scripts for data visualization.

* histogram.py: Contains a histogram class which is useful for plotting ENCs, testing their normalization, integrating over variables, finding sub-histograms, etc..

* plotter.py: Plotter class inspired by the MIT Open Data plot format.

* utils/: Python utility modules.

* encs/: Project-specific plotting code for ENCs.


bin/: Compiled binaries and executable files.


output/: Directory for storing output data and generated figures.

* new_encs/: Output data files from ENC computations.

* new_enc_figures/: Figures and plots generated from the data.

Makefile.inc: Configuration file for compilation settings.

README.md: Project documentation.
