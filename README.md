## Introduction

ECScribe is a project dedicated to computing energy-weighted correlation in particle physics datasets.
It facilitates analysis on both simulated data from Pythia and real data from the CMS Open Data.


## Features

- **Jet Properties**:

  Basic properties of jets -- useful for testing the structure of the C++ code and for seeing how python histograms can be plotted.

- **New Angles on Energy Correlators**:

  Introduces a new parameterization for N-point Energy Correlators (ENCs) as detailed in [2410.xxxx].

- **Energy Weighted Observable Correlations (EWOCs)**:

  Not yet included: will introduce a new type of energy correlator on non-angular observables as detailed in [24yy.xxxx].

- **Python Classes**:

  * `./plot/plotter.py` contains a python plotting class inspired by the MIT Open Data plotting format;
  * `./plot/histogram.py` contains a python histogram class with several functionalities, including:
      - integrating out variables;
      - finding sub-histograms;
      - plotting 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional data;
  * Examples of the usage for these classes can be found, for example, in `./plot/jet_properties`.


## Installation

To install ECScribe, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/samcaf/ECScribe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

    ```
    cd ECScribe
    ```

3. **Configure the Makefile**

    Before compiling the code, you'll need to edit `Makefile.inc` to set up the necessary directories:
    * Open `Makefile.inc` in your preferred text editor.
    * Modify the following variables to match the installation paths and versions on your system:
      - `SOFTWARE_DIR`
      - `PYTHIA_DIR`
      - `FASTJET_DIR`

4. **Compile the Code**

    Run `make` to compile all relevant C++ code, prepare output directories, download a text file containing the CMS 2011A Jet Primary Dataset (from [here](https://github.com/abudhraj/FastEEC/releases/tag/0.1) to `write/data`, and set up a Python virtual environment
    ```
    make
    ```

5. **Configure Open Data File Path**

    If you intend to use information from  the CMS Open Data 2011A Jet Primary Dataset:
    * Open `write/include/opendata_utils.h`.
    * Change the `cms_jets_file` variable to point to the location of the CMS Open Data file on your machine.



## Usage

After installation, you are ready to start computing Energy-Weighted Correlations!


### Jet Properties

To generate histogram files containing jet properties (mass, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, etc.) with the keyword `opendata_test` in the directory `./output/jet_properties/`, try running the following command:
```
./write/jet_properties --use_opendata true --n_events 100000 --nbins 100 --file_prefix opendata_test
```
You can look at/use/modify the plotting tools in `./plot/jet_properties` for some example plots of jet masses.
Additional examples, including examples for computing ENCs in Pythia, can be found in `./bin/`.


### New Angles on Energy Correlators

To generate files containing N-Point Energy Correlators (ENCs) with the keyword `opendata_test` in the directory `./output/new_encs/`, try running one of the commands below.

You can use the plotting tools in `./plot/encs`, which can be modified to produce your own versions of the plots from [2410.xxxx].
Additional examples for computing ENCs, including examples for computing ENCs in Pythia, can be found in `./bin/`.

#### Projected ENCs (PENCs)

<img src="output/display/od_highN_1d.png" width="200"> <img src="output/display/w_combined_1d.png" width="200">

Generate PENCs by running:

```
./write/new_enc/2particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 --n_events 100000 --nbins 200 --file_prefix opendata_test
```
The weight 1.0 indicates the energy weight associated with a particle in the jet -- or the value of N-1 for the ENC. It can be replaced by any list of weights (any list of the desired values for N-1);

#### Resolved 3-Point ENCs (RE3Cs)

<img src="output/display/qcd_3particle_bullseye.png" width="200"> <img src="output/display/od_newdef_density.png" width="200">

Generate RE3Cs with:

```
./write/new_enc/3particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 1.0 --n_events 100000 --nbins 150 --file_prefix opendata_test
```
The weights (1.0, 1.0) indicate the energy weights associated with a pair of resolved particles, and can be changed to any pair or list of pairs;

#### Resolved 4-Point ENCs (RE4Cs)

<img src="output/display/od_4particle_bullseye.png" width="200"> <img src="output/display/od_4particle_bullseye-1.png" width="200">

Generate RE4Cs using:
```
./write/new_enc/4particle --use_opendata true --use_deltaR --use_pt --weights 1.0 1.0 1.0 [or any set of triples] --n_events 100000 --nbins 150 --file_prefix opendata_test
```
The weights (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) can be changed to any list of triples.
